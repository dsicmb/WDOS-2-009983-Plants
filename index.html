                        veins are usually green or sometimes red or white. Juvenile and adult phases differ, making it almost 
                        impossible to identify different species of small plants.Most philodendrons are great climbers, usually
                        growing upward by wrapping their modified roots around the trunks of trees. Once they have worked their way up to the canopy, they often transform 
                        themselves into epiphytes. Plants with this life strategy are called secondary hemiepiphytes. 
                        Unlike most plants, the seedlings of hemiepiphytes do not grow toward the Sun; instead they grow 
                        toward a tree trunk.<br><br>

        <p>Unique flower emblems represent the Sri Lankan provinces and territories. These symbols represent the sovereignty and the various provincial identities. 
           They express the different features of a province or territory. The provincial floral symbols account for the flora of an area. 
           The endangered status of that plant and the cultural and religious connection to the plant are some of the other reasons upon which these
           flowers were chosen.
