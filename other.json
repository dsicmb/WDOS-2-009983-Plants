            "description" : "ZZ Plant is an evergreen perinial growing to 45cm (18in), with round, pale, glossy green leaves. The upper surfaces of the leaves are marked with dark green blotches along the veins, and the lower surfaces coloured deep purple, with leaf shafts that are very thin. When new leaves grow they are rolled up and display their pinkish-red undersides. Like others in the genus, it has a horizontal soil stem, rhizome from which the plants grow up and the roots develop. It requires a minimum temperature of 16°C (61°F), and in temperate areas is often cultivated as a houseplant.This plant also raises and closes its leaves at night and opens them up again as dawn breaks.",

The inflorescence bears small flowers which are perfect, containing male and female structures. The flowers are contained in close together spirals on the spadix. The spadix is often elongated into a spike shape, but it can be globe-shaped or club-shaped. Beneath the spadix is the spathe, a type of bract. This is variable in shape, as well, but it is lance-shaped in many species. It may extend out flat or in a curve. Sometimes it covers the spadix like a hood. The fruits develop from the flowers on the spadix. They are juicy berries varying in color, usually containing two seeds.",

Certain species of Spathiphyllum are commonly known as spath or peace lilies.They are evergreen herbaceous perennial plants with large leaves 12-65 cm long and 3-25cm broad. The flowers are produced in a spadix, surrounded by a 10-30cm long, white, yellowish, or greenish spathe. The plant does not need large amounts of light or water to survive. They are most often grown as houseplants, however they are able to withstand the elements well enough to thrive when planted outdoors in situations that are hot and humid.",

They are barbed and thinner than the finest human hairs, detaching in large numbers upon the slightest touch. If not removed they will cause considerable skin irritation so the plants must be treated with caution.The Latin specific epithet microdasys means “small and hairy”.The yellow flowers appear only rarely. Despite this, it is a very popular cactus in cultivation, partly because of the young plant's comical resemblance to a rabbit's head.",
