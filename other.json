The upper surfaces of the leaves are marked with dark green blotches along the veins, and the lower surfaces coloured deep purple, with leaf shafts that are very thin. When new leaves grow they are rolled up and display their pinkish-red undersides. Like others in the genus, it has a horizontal soil stem, rhizome from which the plants grow up and the roots develop. It requires a minimum temperature of 16°C (61°F), and in temperate areas is often cultivated as a houseplant.This plant also raises and closes its leaves at night and opens them up again as dawn breaks.",

There are thousands of named cultivars of this species (sometimes listed as C. x hortulanum), but other species and hybrids are sometimes available. Although they are only hardy to zone 9 or 10, they are easily grown as summer “bulbs” or as houseplants.The two main types of caladiums are the fancy- leaved types, which have large, heart-shaped or semi-heart-shaped leaves on long petioles (12 to 30 inches tall), while the strap- or lance-leaved types, with their shorter and narrower, ruffle-edged leaves on short petioles, are more compact (usually less than 12 inches tall). The lance-leaved types (derived from C.picturantum) have more leaves per tuber than fancy-leaved types.",

In nature, these plants grow underneath a tree canopy, so the alocasia naturally develops large leaves to help give it an edge over other plants when it comes to soaking up sunlight. Some varieties of alocasia will grow into massive plants with exceptionally large leaves. Smaller types (Jewel Alocasias) are available that are more manageable and will not take over your home if space is a concern. Expect your alocasia to proliferate during the warmer months. These fast-growing houseplants can push out new leaves almost weekly when actively growing. Alocasia will hold steady until the next growing season when the weather turns cold. Under the right conditions, your alocasia will bloom.

Stem, or even leaf, cuttings can root if given proper conditions, which makes it quite valuable in the horticultural industry.
