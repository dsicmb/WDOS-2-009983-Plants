            "description" : "Goeppertia makoyanaa is an evergreen perinial growing to 45cm (18in), with round, pale, glossy green leaves. The upper surfaces of the leaves are marked with dark green blotches along the veins, and the lower surfaces coloured deep purple, with leaf shafts that are very thin. When new leaves grow they are rolled up and display their pinkish-red undersides. Like others in the genus, it has a horizontal soil stem, rhizome from which the plants grow up and the roots develop. It requires a minimum temperature of 16°C (61°F), and in temperate areas is often cultivated as a houseplant.Like other “prayer plant”, this plant also raises and closes its leaves at night and opens them up again as dawn breaks.",

The inflorescence bears small flowers which are perfect, containing male and female structures. The flowers are contained in close together spirals on the spadix. The spadix is often elongated into a spike shape, but it can be globe-shaped or club-shaped. Beneath the spadix is the spathe, a type of bract. This is variable in shape, as well, but it is lance-shaped in many species. It may extend out flat or in a curve. Sometimes it covers the spadix like a hood. The fruits develop from the flowers on the spadix. They are juicy berries varying in color, usually containing two seeds.",

They are barbed and thinner than the finest human hairs, detaching in large numbers upon the slightest touch. If not removed they will cause considerable skin irritation so the plants must be treated with caution.The Latin specific epithet microdasys means “small and hairy”.The yellow flowers appear only rarely.

Syngonium albo, like other arrowhead vines, grow in tropical forests where they creep along jungle floors and climb up the base of tree trunks with their aerial roots in search of light. As their natural habitat is shaded by the foliage of taller trees, syngonium have evolved to tolerate a wide range of lighting conditions, including partial shade.A fast-growing vine, syngonium is a beginner-friendly plant that can be trained to climb up a trellis or a moss pole or allowed to cascade naturally over pot edges for a softer look. When properly maintained, syngonium albo can grow quite large, reaching well over 6’ in length!",

They slowly mature to a deeper, truly dark green with inclination to nearly black, and oldest leaves on the lowest part of the plant darkest and dullest. Flowers can arise during the warm months at anytime, being a blackish-red, cloak-like wrapping spathe around a white, finger-like spadix.Philodendrons grow best in medium light and bright indirect sunlight. Older leaves turn yellow naturally. However, several leaves turns yellow at once, it could be an indicator that the plant is getting too much sun. They will tolerate low light, but if the stems become leggy with several inches between the leaves, move the plant to a brighter location.",

Calathea Medallion is part of the prayer plant family that sometimes people call it prayer-plants, but they are not true prayer-plants. The difference between Calathea Medallion and prayer-plants is in their leaves. Prayer plants' leaves fold upright at the base of the stem resembling praying hands. Meanwhile, if the leaves of your Calathea Medallion would curl up from the outer edges inward toward the central vein, check the environment because this means there's a problem with the environment where you placed your Calathea Medallion .Calatheas are tropical plants that can grow from 6 to 36 inches at most.
